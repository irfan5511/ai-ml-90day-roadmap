## Getting Started

```bash
# 1) Create & activate venv
bash scripts/setup_venv.sh

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Launch Jupyter
jupyter lab

# 4) Run tests
bash scripts/run_tests.sh

# 5) Try a starter app
streamlit run project_templates/STREAMLIT_APP_TEMPLATE.py
```

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
